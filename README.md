imageprocessing
===============

This project contains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) demonstrating the effects of
discrete wavelet transforms (Haar Wavelet), and hopefully others in the near future
(e.g. CDF 9/7 and LeGall).

Also included in this project is a fully implementated codec for JPEG in the Java
programming language.
